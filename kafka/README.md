# Adaptive Alerting - Kafka

## Running KStream app locally with maven

Need to build (if other modules have been updated those will need to be re-built with `mvn install`):

```bash
mvn compile
```

Run the following with the appropriate `mainClass`:

```bash
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.expedia.adaptivealerting.kafka.KafkaAnomalyDetectorMapper
```

## Running KStream apps in docker

Need to package the app (if other modules have been updated those will need to be re-built with `mvn install`):

```bash
mvn clean package
```

Build the docker image (use the appropriate script for the app):

```bash
docker/scripts/build-{APP_NAME e.g. constant-detector}.sh -b
```

Run pre-built docker image:

```bash
docker run {APP_NAME}
```

To do all these steps: run maven package, build the docker image and run it (use the appropriate script for the app):
   
```bash
docker/scripts/build-{APP_NAME}.sh -p -b -r
```

### Troubleshooting

1. If you get an error indicating that the topic is not present (TODO provide the exact error message here), then your
   Kafka instance might not be set to automatically add topics. Try creating them manually:
   
    ```bash
    kafka-topics --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic aa-metrics
    kafka-topics --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic mapped-metrics
    kafka-topics --create --zookeeper localhost:2181 --replication-factor 1 --partitions 1 --topic anomalies
    kafka-topics --list --zookeeper localhost:2181
    ```
    
    If `kafka-topics` is not found you will need to locate `kafka-topics` or `kafka-topics.sh` file
     (might be in the bin directory of your kafka install) and use that to run the command.
   
1. If you get an error:

    ```java
    Caused by: org.apache.kafka.common.config.ConfigException: No resolvable bootstrap urls given in bootstrap.servers
    ```
    
    Try adding the following entry to your hosts file:
    
    ```bash
    {YOUR_EXTERNAL_IP} kafkasvc
    ```

1. If you get an error:

    ```java
    java.net.ConnectException: Exception connecting to HostAndPort{host='monitoring-influxdb-graphite.kube-system.svc', port=2003}
    ```
    
    Try adding the following entry to your hosts file:
    
    ```bash
    {YOUR_EXTERNAL_IP} monitoring-influxdb-graphite.kube-system.svc
    ```
    
    you may also need something to listen on that port so you can run:
    
    ```bash
    python -m SimpleHTTPServer 2003
    ```
